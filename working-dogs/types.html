    <h2>Why We Love Working Dogs</h2>
    <p>While our imaginary workplace pups are fun, real dogs are out there doing incredible jobs every day. From guiding the visually impaired to detecting illness, these dogs aren’t just good—they’re amazing.</p>

      <h3>Guide Dogs</h3>
      <p>Guide dogs help people who are blind or visually impaired navigate the world safely. They stay calm in crowds, ignore distractions, and even disobey dangerous commands if needed.</p>
