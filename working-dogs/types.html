    <h2>Real Dogs Doing Jobs</h2>
    <p>While our imaginary workplace pups are fun, real dogs are out there doing incredible jobs every day. From guiding the visually impaired to detecting illness, these dogs aren’t just good—they’re amazing.</p>

        <h2 id="caption">Sled Dog – Serum Run to Nome</h2>
      </div>
      <p>
        Togo was the true hero of the 1925 serum run to Nome, Alaska, covering over 260 miles through 
        harsh conditions to deliver life-saving diphtheria antitoxin. Though Balto got more public recognition, Togo’s
         endurance and leadership saved countless lives and earned him the title of “Greatest Dog That Ever Lived” 
         by many mushers.

      <p>
        Appollo (with two Ls!) was the first search-and-rescue dog on site at Ground Zero after the 
        World Trade Center attacks. As part of the NYPD K9 unit and FEMA task force, he searched through 
        dangerous debris for survivors. Appollo was awarded the Dickin Medal, the animal equivalent of the 
        Victoria Cross, for his bravery.

        Sergeant Stubby was a stray Boston Terrier mix who became the most decorated dog of World War I. 
        He served with the 102nd Infantry Regiment in France, warning troops of gas attacks, finding wounded 
        soldiers, and even capturing a German spy. Stubby earned the rank of sergeant through sheer bravery and 
        was beloved by his unit and beyond. He later became a celebrity and led parades across the U.S.

        Jumpy was a Border Collie mix known for his precise obedience and impressive stunts in film and

        <h2 id="caption">Search-and-Rescue Dog – 9/11 Hero</h2>
      </div>
      <p>
        Bretagne (pronounced Brittany) was a golden retriever and FEMA-certified search-and-rescue dog 
        who served with her handler during the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. At just two years old, she 
        worked tirelessly at Ground Zero, searching for survivors and offering comfort to first responders. 
        Bretagne also responded to natural disasters like Hurricane Katrina. She was honored as one of the 
        last surviving 9/11 search dogs and received a hero’s farewell in 2016.
