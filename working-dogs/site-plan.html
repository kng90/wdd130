<strong>Site Purpose</strong><br>
Welcome to Fetch & Frolic! This isn’t just another dog website. This is 
where dogs work, play, and occasionally nap on the job. Fetch & Frolic is 
your go-to destination for a good laugh, a soft "awww," and the kind of 
canine chaos that comes from imagining dogs with full-time jobs and huge 
personalities.<br><br>

<strong>Why I Built This</strong><br>
I were inspired by the idea that dogs might just be better at our jobs 
than humans are—and a whole lot cuter doing them. From Barketing Managers 
to Chief Nap Officers, I started imagining what the workplace would look 
like if dogs ran the show. It got a little silly.<br><br>

<strong>Audience and Tone</strong><br>
This site is made for dog lovers, overworked humans, and anyone who needs 
a break from grown-up responsibilities. If you’ve ever wished your 
coworkers had more fur and fewer opinions, you’re in the right place.<br><br>


<strong>Site Navigation Overview</strong><br>
On this site, you’ll find:<br>
1. Funny Dog Jobs – Meet the working dogs living their best lives.<br>
2. Real Dogs Doing Jobs – A spotlight on incredible real-life working dogs.

      <h3>Funny Dog Jobs</h3>
<p>
<strong>Workplace Setup</strong><br>
Dogs with jobs? You bet. Not just service dogs or police pups—we’re talking career dogs with business cards, headshots, and an inflated sense of self-worth. This page is where you'll meet the Barkforce.<br><br>

<strong>Pawffice Manager – Barley</strong><br>
Barley keeps the team on track mostly by wagging his tail encouragingly and nudging coworkers for belly rubs. He’s never sent a Slack message, but everyone still listens to him.<br><br>

<strong>Chief Snack Officer – Mochi</strong><br>
Mochi is responsible for taste-testing every snack on-site. She takes her job very seriously and often “accidentally” eats other people's lunches. It’s fine—she’s in charge of snacks.<br><br>

<strong>Lead Zoomie Strategist – Luna</strong><br>
Luna has engineered the perfect office route for maximum zoomie velocity. Her hallway sprints are inspirational and mildly terrifying.<br><br>

<strong>Head of Barketing – Rusty</strong><br>
Rusty runs our social media presence with plenty of flair and howling commentary. His latest campaign, “Bark Like You Mean It,” got over 3 likes. Big success.<br><br>

<strong>Team Benefits</strong><br>
All team members enjoy unlimited nap breaks, stock options in squeaky toys, paid paw-ternity leave, and at least one treat per hour.

      <h3>Real Dogs Doing Jobs</h3>
<p>
<strong>Why We Love Working Dogs</strong><br>
While our imaginary workplace pups are fun, real dogs are out there doing 
incredible jobs every day. From guiding the visually impaired to detecting 
illness, these dogs aren’t just good—they’re amazing.<br><br>

<strong>Guide Dogs</strong><br>
Guide dogs help people who are blind or visually impaired navigate the 
world safely. They stay calm in crowds, ignore distractions, and even 
disobey dangerous commands if needed.<br><br>

<strong>Therapy Dogs</strong><br>
Therapy dogs provide comfort in hospitals, schools, and disaster areas. 
They help lower stress, ease anxiety, and bring smiles to people who need 
it most.<br><br>

<strong>Search and Rescue Dogs</strong><br>
From natural disasters to missing person cases, SAR dogs use their sense 
of smell and stamina to find people.<br><br>

<strong>Detection Dogs</strong><br>
Detection dogs sniff out everything from explosives to diseases. They’re 
the scientists of the dog world—except much cuter.<br><br>

<strong>Police and Military Dogs</strong><br>
K9 units assist police and military teams with tracking, searching, and 
suspect apprehension.<br><br>

<strong>Retirement and Recognition</strong><br>
Working dogs retire too—often to loving homes where they get to nap 
guilt-free. Some are honored for their service.<br><br>
