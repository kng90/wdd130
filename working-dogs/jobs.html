    <h2>Funny Dog Jobs</h2>
    <section class="intro">
      <h3>Workplace Setup</h3>
      <p>Dogs with jobs? You bet. Not just service dogs or police pups—we’re talking career dogs with business cards, headshots, and an inflated sense of self-worth. This page is where you'll meet the Barkforce.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="dog-job">
      <h3>Pawffice Manager – Barley</h3>
      <p>Barley keeps the team on track mostly by wagging his tail encouragingly and nudging coworkers for belly rubs. He’s never sent a Slack message, but everyone still listens to him.</p>

    <section class="dog-job">
      <h3>Chief Snack Officer – Mochi</h3>
      <p>Mochi is responsible for taste-testing every snack on-site. She takes her job very seriously and often “accidentally” eats other people's lunches. It’s fine—she’s in charge of snacks.</p>

      <h3>Lead Zoomie Strategist – Luna</h3>
      <p>Luna has engineered the perfect office route for maximum zoomie velocity. Her hallway sprints are inspirational and mildly terrifying.</p>

    <section class="dog-job">
      <h3>Head of Barketing – Rusty</h3>
      <p>Rusty runs our social media presence with plenty of flair and howling commentary. His latest campaign, “Bark Like You Mean It,” got over 3 likes. Big success.</p>

    <section class="benefits">
      <h3>Team Benefits</h3>
      <p>All team members enjoy unlimited nap breaks, stock options in squeaky toys, paid paw-ternity leave, and at least one treat per hour.</p>
