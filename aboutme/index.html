        <p>I was born and raised in Atlanta, GA. I spent the bulk of my 20s<br>
            traveling around the world and came back home to stay. I have been <br>
            married almost 8 years to my husband Scott. We have two incredible<br>
            kids: our girl Chandler is two and our boy Bodie will be one in May <br>
            We love to camp, hike, explore, and travel to places we've never <br>
            seen before. I really enjoy dancing, baking, and hanging out with<br>
            good people.   
        </p>

            Through a strange series of events, I left BYU-Idaho in the Winter<br> 
            of 2015 with only one semester left to graduate. I ended up working<br>
            as a graphic designer, but quickly bored of sitting at a desk all day.<br>
            I became a flight attendant for a few years and worked in marketing<br>
            until I had my daughter. Now I am lucky enough to be a stay-at-home-mom<br> 
            and work part-time as a travel agent. I am excited to finally finish up<br> 
            my degree and get that under my belt. Can't wait to work with all of you<br>
            and get to know you!
